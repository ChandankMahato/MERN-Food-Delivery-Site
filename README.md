About this project

Almost every business greatly makes use of the internet today. Realizing this, we have come up with an e-commerce website ‘Get Your Food’. ‘Get Your Food’ is a food delivery website with which anyone can order their desired meal online. Additionally, 'Get Your Food’ also helps the restaurant to manage their menu, prices, and other details. The main objective of ‘Get Your Food’ is to help the restaurant owners to manage their restaurants and the customers to order meals efficiently.
